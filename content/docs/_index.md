## What is Meshtastic?

Imagine a world where you can stay connected with your team, even when you're far off the grid.
That's the magic of Meshtasticâ€”an open-source, decentralized, off-grid mesh network powered by affordable, long-range LoRa radios.

> These compact communicators form a seamless network and can link to your phone via Bluetooth or Wi-Fi.
> Meshtastic ensures you're always connected. Learn more on the official website.

## How Does It Work?

Meshtastic operates in the 915 MHz frequency range, leveraging the powerful LoRa protocol to create an interconnected web of communication.
Here's the magic behind it:

- Radios running Meshtastic software form a resilient, self-healing mesh network.
- Connect to these devices via Bluetooth for nearby use or through handheld nodes that double as repeaters.
- Messages effortlessly hop from node to node, extending your reach and building a robust communication chain.
